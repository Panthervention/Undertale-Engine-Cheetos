# Undertale Engine - Cheetos's TML Edit
A heavily modified TML engine by Panthervention

This engine edition features blue soul related functionalities,
and mostly Sans related assets for battle (bone, blaster, platform, kr)
with a small demo.

# Announcement (30/03/2025)
- From now on, when there is update, I will compile the project into an yymps. And you should only work from the yymps! So if there is a future update, you can just drag the yymps into your current Cheetos build without having to migrate your entire project over the new update (should have done this earlier lmfao).
- The project repo will receive more frequent update without actual releases. So if you decide to "Download ZIP" the code, do it on your own risk, and expect codes in development stages, or straight up broken prototype codes!
