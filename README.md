# TML's Undertale Engine - Cheetos's Edition
A heavily modified TML engine by Panthervention for GameMaker 2024.13+

This engine edition features blue soul related functionalities, and mostly Sans related assets for battle (bone, blaster, platform, kr) with a small demo.

# How do I import?
- For project setup, you should download and load the .yyz file so you can also import engine's proper settings like Texture Groups and some project behaviors.
- For updates, you can download the .yymps instead and import the assets directly from there, so you don't have to start over again when the update comes.
